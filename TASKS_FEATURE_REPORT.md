# Tasks Feature Review and Implementation Report

## Issues Identified

After a thorough review of the Wizzo application's code, particularly focusing on the Tasks feature, I've identified several critical issues:

1. **Architectural Mismatch**: The implementation attempted to use Prisma ORM while the application uses Drizzle ORM.
   
2. **Missing Dependencies**: The code referenced `@hookform/resolvers/zod` which wasn't installed in the project.
   
3. **Non-Existent Components**: The Tasks page was trying to import components that didn't exist (`TaskList`, `CreateTaskSheet`).
   
4. **Schema Inconsistency**: The code was trying to use a `Task` model from Prisma, but the application uses a different schema structure with `taskItem` in Drizzle.
   
5. **Authentication Mismatch**: The API routes were using an outdated authentication method instead of the application's current auth setup.

## Fixes Implemented

I've made the following changes to address these issues:

1. **Temporary Tasks Page**: Created a simple "Coming Soon" page for the Tasks tab, preventing the 500 error.
   
2. **API Route Updates**: Modified the API routes to use Drizzle ORM instead of Prisma, aligning with the application's architecture.
   
3. **Authentication Fix**: Updated the routes to use the correct authentication method (`auth()` from lib/auth).
   
4. **Task Type Definition**: Created a proper Task type based on the application's actual schema.
   
5. **Implementation Plan**: Created a comprehensive plan for properly implementing the Tasks feature in phases.

## Current Status

The application now:
- Shows a "Coming Soon" message on the Tasks tab instead of crashing
- Has functioning API routes that correctly interact with the database (though not yet used in the UI)
- Contains a detailed plan for complete implementation of the Tasks feature

## Recommendations

1. **Follow the Implementation Plan**: The TASKS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md document provides a phased approach to implementing the feature correctly.

2. **Consistency with Existing Patterns**: Ensure all new code follows the application's existing patterns for:
   - Database access (using Drizzle ORM)
   - Authentication
   - UI components and styling
   - Error handling

3. **Component Development**: Develop UI components iteratively, testing each one thoroughly before integration.

4. **User Testing**: Once the basic functionality is implemented, conduct user testing to validate the workflow and UX.

## Next Steps

1. **Create Essential Components**: Develop the basic UI components for task management.

2. **Implement Project Management**: Set up the project selection and management functionality.

3. **Enable Basic Task Operations**: Implement creating, editing, completing, and deleting tasks.

4. **Add Advanced Features**: Once the basics are working, add labels, filters, and different task views.

The Tasks feature has great potential to enhance the application's utility. By following the implementation plan and maintaining consistency with the rest of the application, it will provide users with a seamless and intuitive task management experience.
