## Task Information

- **Task ID**: 2.1
- **Phase**: 2 - Model Integration
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Created**: 2025-05-12
- **Start Time**: 2025-05-12 20:16:02
- **Completion Time**: [Timestamp to be added manually]
- **Assigned To**: AI Agent

## Task Description

Add the Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash models alongside the existing Grok models, applying LostMind brand names and ensuring proper integration with the AI SDK.

## Requirements

- [x] Use AI SDK v4.3.13+ (or latest) and relevant SDKs (`@ai-sdk/google`, existing `@ai-sdk/xai`).
- [x] Add Gemini 2.5 Pro model as "LostMind Quantum" (reasoning) and "LostMind Vision Pro" alongside existing Grok models.
- [x] Add Gemini 2.5 Flash model as "LostMind Flash" alongside existing Grok models.
- [x] Configure Gemini models with proper API key from environment variables (GEMINI_API_KEY).
- [x] Set appropriate temperature and token settings for each new Gemini model.
- [x] Ensure existing Grok models remain functional.
- [x] Implement error handling for model interactions, considering multiple providers.
- [x] Maintain TypeScript type safety throughout.
- [x] Defer OpenAI model integration to a future task.

## File Locations

- Primary: `/lib/ai/models.ts` - Update model definitions
- Primary: `/lib/ai/providers.ts` - Configure provider
- Reference: `/components/model-selector.tsx` - UI integration

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All models (existing Grok + new Gemini) appear in model selector with correct LostMind branding
- [ ] Existing Grok models continue to function properly
- [ ] New Gemini models work correctly with appropriate configuration
- [ ] Model switching works seamlessly (preserves context)
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages API issues
- [ ] Type safety is maintained throughout

## Implementation Notes

Refactored types, models, providers, and API route to support Google Gemini alongside existing XAI Grok models.

## Time Log

- Task Start: [Timestamp to be added by AI]
- Task Complete: [Timestamp to be added manually]
- Total Time: [Duration to be calculated manually]

## Testing Notes

[Manual testing required: Verify Grok and Gemini model functionality via UI, check model selector, test error handling (e.g., invalid API key).]

## Implementation Approach

This task adopts an incremental approach:

1. Keep existing functionality (Grok models) intact
2. Add new Gemini models alongside existing ones
3. Ensure both providers (XAI and Google) work together
4. Enable seamless model switching while preserving context
5. Defer OpenAI integration to a future phase
