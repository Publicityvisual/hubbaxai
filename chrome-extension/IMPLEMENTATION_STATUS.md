## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Files Created/Modified

#### Manifest Configuration
- Updated `manifest.json` with side panel configuration
- Added necessary permissions and web accessible resources

#### Background Script
- Modified `background.js` to support side panel behavior
- Implemented service worker initialization
- Enhanced message handling for side panel communication

#### Side Panel Components
- Created modular component structure:
  - `sidepanel/index.html` - Main side panel UI
  - `sidepanel/styles.css` - Styling for side panel
  - `sidepanel/sidepanel.js` - Main JavaScript controller
  - `sidepanel/components/auth.js` - Authentication functionality
  - `sidepanel/components/recording.js` - Recording functionality
  - `sidepanel/components/notes.js` - Notes functionality
  - `sidepanel/components/sync-status.js` - Sync status functionality

### Maintained Functionality
