# Code Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address the PDF processing and route parameter issues.

## 1. PDF Processing Fixes

### Problem
The server code was attempting to use the `pdf-parse` library which wasn't installed, resulting in "Module not found" errors.

### Solution
We've implemented a complete client-side PDF processing solution and removed all server-side dependencies on `pdf-parse`:

1. **Removed server-side dependencies**:
   - Removed all attempts to load `pdf-parse` in server code
   - Updated the PDF extraction logic to not rely on any external libraries
   - Modified the API route to inform users that PDF processing now happens client-side

2. **Created client-side alternative**:
   - Implemented PDF.js-based text extraction that runs in the browser
   - Created a PDF extraction component for the UI
   - Updated the workflow to process PDFs entirely on the client side

3. **Benefits**:
   - No npm dependencies required for PDF processing
   - Better user experience (real-time extraction, ability to edit)
   - Reduced server load
   - More resilient architecture

## 2. Next.js Route Parameter Issue

### Problem
The application was showing warnings about using `params.id` synchronously which is not allowed in Next.js App Router:
```
Error: Route "/api/knowledge/[id]" used `params.id`. `params` should be awaited before using its properties.
```

### Solution
Updated the `getIdParam` function in `/app/api/utils/params.ts` to properly await the params object:

```typescript
export async function getIdParam(params: { id: string | Promise<string> }): Promise<string> {
  // Make sure to await the params object first
  const resolvedParams = await params;
  return getParam(resolvedParams.id);
}
```

This ensures that we're correctly handling the asynchronous nature of route parameters in Next.js, which can be Promises in development mode.

## Testing

After these changes, you should:

1. No longer see "Module not found: Can't resolve 'pdf-parse'" errors
2. No longer see route parameter related warnings
3. Be able to upload and process PDF files through the client-side interface

If any errors persist, please check the browser console and server logs for more details.
