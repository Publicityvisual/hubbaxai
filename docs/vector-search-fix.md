# Vector Search Fix

This document explains the fixes implemented to address issues with vector search in the knowledge base.

## Problem

The logs showed several issues with vector search:

1. PostgreSQL vector extension was not enabled in the database (`type "vector" does not exist`)
2. Field naming and type issues in the drizzle schema
3. TypeScript type compatibility issues

## Solution

We've implemented a comprehensive fix that:

1. Adds the required `pgvector` extension to PostgreSQL
2. Modifies the schema to include a proper vector column with consistent naming
3. Updates all queries to use the vector column
4. Fixes type compatibility issues
5. Provides graceful fallbacks when vector search isn't available

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema

The `KnowledgeChunk` table has been updated to include a dedicated vector column with consistent naming and proper defaults:

```typescript
export const knowledgeChunk = pgTable('KnowledgeChunk', {
  // ... existing fields
  embedding: text('embedding'),            // Keep for backwards compatibility
  embeddingVector: vector(1536).notNull().default([]), // Vector column with defaults
  // ... other fields
});
```

### 2. Migration Script

A SQL migration script has been created to:
- Enable the pgvector extension
- Add the vector column to the KnowledgeChunk table
- Convert existing text embeddings to vector format
- Create an index for faster vector searches

### 3. Updated Code

The following files have been updated:
- `lib/db/schema.ts` - Updated vector column with proper naming and defaults
- `lib/db/queries.ts` - Fixed type compatibility and updated field names
- `lib/knowledge/localFiles/localSearch.ts` - Updated vector search query with correct field names
- `lib/knowledge/localFiles/documentProcessor.ts` - Fixed type compatibility issues

### 4. Fallback Mechanisms

The search now implements a series of fallbacks:
1. First tries vector search
2. If that fails, tries basic text matching
3. If no matches, returns most recent documents

## How to Run the Fix

Execute the following steps to apply the fix:

1. Install the pgvector extension in your PostgreSQL database:
   ```bash
   # Connect to your database
   psql your_database_name
   
   # Run this command
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
   ```

2. Run the migration script:
   ```bash
   # From the project root
   npm run fix:vector-search
   ```

3. Restart your application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Testing

After applying the fix, you can test that vector search is working by:
1. Adding a new document to the knowledge base
2. Asking a question related to that document
3. Verify that the system references the correct information

If for any reason vector search still doesn't work, the system will automatically fall back to other search methods.
