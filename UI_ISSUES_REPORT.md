# UI Issues Report

## Task Management Tab Issues

1. **Empty UI Screen**
   - Problem: The Task Management tab appears empty despite code showing it should display multiple UI elements.
   - Expected Behavior: The page should display a Task Management heading, filtering options, and task list or empty state placeholder.

2. **Missing Components**
   - The following components are not rendering:
     - Task management header
     - Filtering toolbar (project filter, sort options, show/hide completed)
     - Task list table
     - Add Task button
     - Empty state placeholder when no tasks exist

3. **Potential Causes**
   - Data fetching issues: The page attempts to fetch tasks and projects from the database but may be failing
   - Component rendering issues: The `TaskManagementClient` component may not be properly rendering its children
   - CSS/styling issues: Elements might be present but not visible due to styling problems
   - Database connection issues: Failed connection to the task database tables

4. **Critical Path Components**
   - `TaskManagementClient`: Main client component responsible for displaying the UI
   - `TaskTable`: Displays the task list
   - `EmptyTasksPlaceholder`: Shown when no tasks exist
   - `TaskDialog`: Form for adding/editing tasks

## Extension Tab Issues

1. **Empty UI Screen**
   - Problem: The Extension tab appears empty while it should display multiple UI panels.
   - Expected Behavior: The page should show the Chrome Extension heading, status panel, offline files panel, and usage guide.

2. **Missing Components**
   - The following components are not rendering:
     - Extension page heading
     - `ExtensionStatusPanel`: Shows unprocessed files from Chrome extension
     - `OfflineFilesPanel`: Shows files saved while offline
     - Extension usage guide card

3. **Potential Causes**
   - Client-side rendering issues: Both panels rely on client-side data fetching
   - API endpoint failures: The panels attempt to fetch data from `/api/extension/unprocessed` and `/api/extension/offline-files`
   - Component mounting issues: useEffect hooks may not be triggering properly
   - CSS/styling issues: Elements might be present but not visible

4. **Critical Path Components**
   - `ExtensionStatusPanel`: Shows unprocessed files stats and list
   - `OfflineFilesPanel`: Shows files saved while offline

## Common Issues

1. **API Connection Problems**
   - Both features rely on API endpoints that may be failing
   - Error handling exists but may not be working correctly

2. **CSS/Styling Issues**
   - Hidden elements due to incorrect z-index, positioning, or color settings
   - Layout problems causing elements to be positioned offscreen

3. **Database Issues**
   - Task Management requires database tables that may not be properly set up
   - The database migration for task tables might not have been run

## Next Steps for Debugging

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Look for JavaScript errors that might indicate why components aren't rendering

2. **Verify API Endpoints**
   - Test the task and extension API endpoints directly to see if they return data

3. **Database Setup**
   - Verify that task-related database tables have been created
   - Run the migration script mentioned in TASKS_README.md: `npm run db:migrate`

4. **Component Testing**
   - Add temporary debug outputs in the components to verify they're being mounted
   - Check if data is being fetched successfully but not displayed

5. **CSS Inspection**
   - Use browser dev tools to inspect if elements exist but are hidden or improperly styled
