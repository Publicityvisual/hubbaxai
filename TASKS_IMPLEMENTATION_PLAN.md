# Tasks Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview

The Tasks feature will be implemented to integrate with the existing application's architecture and user experience. This plan outlines the steps needed to properly implement the feature.

## Current State

- The database schema already contains task-related tables (taskProject, taskItem, taskLabel, taskItemLabel)
- The application uses Drizzle ORM (not Prisma as initially assumed)
- The UI navigation has a tasks tab, but the implementation is incomplete
- There are placeholder routes for tasks API

## Phase 1: Basic Tasks Integration

### 1. Fix Current Issues

- [x] Fix the tasks page to display a "Coming Soon" message instead of trying to use non-existent components
- [x] Update API routes to work with Drizzle ORM instead of Prisma
- [x] Fix route handlers to match the current app's authentication pattern

### 2. Create Task Schema Types

- [ ] Create TypeScript types/interfaces that match the database schema for tasks
- [ ] Create validation schemas for task creation and updates

### 3. Implement Basic Projects Management

- [ ] Create a default project for new users
- [ ] Create API endpoints for project management (CRUD operations)
- [ ] Implement project selection UI

## Phase 2: Task Management UI

### 1. Task List Components

- [ ] Create TaskList component to display tasks
- [ ] Implement task sorting and filtering
- [ ] Create task card components with proper styling

### 2. Task Creation & Editing

- [ ] Create task creation form with validation
- [ ] Implement task editing functionality
- [ ] Add support for setting due dates, priorities, etc.

### 3. Task Status Management

- [ ] Implement UI for marking tasks as complete/incomplete
- [ ] Add support for different priority levels
- [ ] Create UI for managing due dates

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

### 1. Task Labels System

- [ ] Implement label creation and management
- [ ] Add UI for assigning labels to tasks
- [ ] Create label filtering functionality

### 2. Task Views

- [ ] Implement Today, Upcoming, and Projects views
- [ ] Create navigation between different task views
- [ ] Add support for custom filters and saved views

### 3. Task Insights

- [ ] Add task completion statistics
- [ ] Implement productivity insights
- [ ] Create task history view

## Implementation Notes

- Make sure to follow the existing application's design patterns and UX flow
- Use the same UI components as the rest of the application for consistency
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Ensure responsive design works on all device sizes
- Follow best practices for accessibility
