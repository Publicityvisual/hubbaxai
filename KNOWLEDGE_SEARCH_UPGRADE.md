# Knowledge Retrieval System Upgrade

This document explains the improvements made to the knowledge retrieval system to enhance search capabilities, particularly for CV/resume content and non-Latin text.

## Changes Implemented

1. **Added Full-Text Search Capabilities**
   - Added PostgreSQL full-text search with proper indexing
   - Created tsvector column for efficient text matching
   - Added automatic indexing via database triggers

2. **Improved Query Processing**
   - Added query preprocessing to extract key terms
   - Implemented special handling for resume/CV-specific queries
   - Enhanced detection of company names and roles

3. **Better Search Logic**
   - Implemented multi-stage search fallback mechanism
   - Added proper ranking of search results
   - Improved handling of text normalization

4. **Temperature Configuration**
   - Set temperature to 0.3 for more deterministic knowledge-based responses

## How to Apply These Changes

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

Run the migration script to add full-text search capabilities to your database:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/apply-fts-migration.sh

# Run the script
./scripts/apply-fts-migration.sh
```

This script will:
- Add a tsvector column to the KnowledgeChunk table
- Create a GIN index for efficient text search
- Setup automatic updates via triggers
- Update existing data

### Step 2: Restart Your Server

After applying the migration, restart your server to ensure all code changes take effect:

```bash
# Restart your development server
npm run dev
```

## How It Works

1. **Query Processing**:
   - When you ask "What was my role at GeoTech?", the system now extracts "GeoTech role"
   - It normalizes text for better matching (especially for non-Latin scripts)
   - It extracts key terms based on question patterns

2. **Multi-Stage Search**:
   - First tries PostgreSQL full-text search with extracted key terms
   - Then falls back to processed query text matching
   - Then tries normalized text matching
   - Finally falls back to recent documents

3. **Result Ranking**:
   - Results from full-text search get highest ranking scores
   - Results from processed queries get higher scores than basic matches
   - Recent documents get lowest scores

## Testing Your Changes

Try asking questions about your CV in different ways:
- "What was my role at [Company]?"
- "What are my skills?"
- "How long did I work at [Company]?"
- "What is my experience with [Technology]?"

The system should now be better at finding relevant information in your CV and other knowledge documents.

## Additional Notes

- The temperature setting of 0.3 means responses will be more consistent and deterministic
- Full-text search works best with English text, but basic normalization is applied for other languages
- The changes include enhanced error handling and logging for better debugging
